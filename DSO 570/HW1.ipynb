    "<br>An interpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer,parses the source code, and interprets the instructions on the fly. Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python. When using interpreter, no intermediate object code is generated, so it is more memory efficient.\n",
    "<br>On the other hand, a compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution. It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. Also, it generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. Programming language like C, C++ use compilers."
